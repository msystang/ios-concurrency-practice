# Summary

Create an app that loads a list of countries.  Selecting a country will go to a detail view controller with more information about that country, including the conversion rate from their currency into USD.

## Endpoints:

- [Country list](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/united)
- [Exchange rates](http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=a17aef5ece92cf36d9c5963f7f4babf1&format=1)
- [Weather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)


## View Controller One:

This view controller should contain a:

- Search Bar
- Table View

Entering a term in the search bar should load the countries with a name matching the search term.  Each cell should have:

- An image of the flag
- The country's name
- The country's capital
- The country's population
- Selecting on a cell should segue to another View Controller

## View Controller Two:

An image of the flag
- The country's name
- The country's capital
- The country's population

## Bonus: Combining APIs

The detail View Controller should also show the following properties.  You will need to make a different network call to get this information:

- The currency and the currency's value in USD
- The current weather
